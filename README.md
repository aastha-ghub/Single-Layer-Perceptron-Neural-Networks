What is Handwritten Digit Recognition?


The handwritten digit recognition is the ability of computers to recognize human handwritten digits. It is a hard task for the machine because handwritten digits are not perfect and can be made with many different flavors. The handwritten digit recognition is the solution to this problem which uses the image of a digit and recognizes the digit present in the image.

The core part of our algorithm is guessing the drawn number. Machine learning will be the tool used to achieve a good guess quality. This kind of basic artificial intelligence allows a system to learn automatically with a given amount of data. In broader terms, machine learning is a process of finding a coincidence or set of coincidences in the data to rely on them to guess the result.


Our image recognition process contains three steps:


Get images of drawn digits for training

Train the system to guess the numbers via training data

Test the system with new/unknown data
